Weblog - Iterative development documenting progress

Theme Philosophy meaning: Exploring the traces left by people has always been the main theme of my artistic creation. I am attracted by the physical and spiritual traces of human existence, which are often very private, unique, and emotional. The starting point of the work is my collection addiction. I have been used to keeping traces of the physical aspects of life since I was very young. I will collect shopping tickets, bar coasters, cinema tickets, theater tickets, concert wristbands, restaurant tickets, exhibition tickets, train tickets, air tickets, tickets for activities, notes written by friends, intimate partner's personal belongings, etc. I keep, collect, sort out and sometimes look through the media of paper evidence in my life.

The process of looking through these collected objects seems to be infinitely close to the memory point of the moment when the event occurred. Touch, look, and feel the collection of objects. It is not only the story that you repeatedly feel countless times. The impact of emotion is layer by layer, complex, iterative, updated, and alternating. The work attempts to explore where the traces are left through the act of disassembling the private objects collected and retained. What is precious to fetishism? What do I look like in my memory? The work is a change of personal behavior based on nihilism to conduct a self-analysis. What will be left behind? What will be remembered? What is meaningful? What is precious?

It is high - Itâ€™s like on a table a device that makes it feel special - be a way to get people to see that dropping
