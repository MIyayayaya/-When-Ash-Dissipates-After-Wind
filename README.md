Brief Description (Physically):
The device works through a real-time collection of wind data from different cities I have lived in, captures the real-time data of wind through the wind speed sensor, send the data to the inner walls of 12 wind bell tubes with dust, triggers the rotor of the servo motor, and finally scatter the ashes in the wind.

Short Overview (Conceptually )：
Exploring the traces left by people has always been the main theme of my artistic creation. I am attracted by the physical and spiritual traces of human existence, which are often very private, unique, and emotional.

The starting point of the work is my collection addiction. I have been used to keeping traces of the physical aspects of life since I was very young. I will collect shopping tickets, bar coasters, cinema tickets, theater tickets, concert wristbands, restaurant tickets, exhibition tickets, train tickets, air tickets, tickets for activities, notes written by friends, intimate partner's personal belongings, etc. I keep, collect, sort out and sometimes look through the media of paper evidence in my life. The process of looking through these collected objects seems to be infinitely close to the memory point of the moment when the event occurred. Touch, look, and feel the collection of objects. It is not only the story that you repeatedly feel countless times. The impact of emotion is layer by layer, complex, iterative, updated, and alternating.

The work attempts to explore where the traces are left through the act of disassembling the private objects collected and retained. What is precious to fetishism? What do I look like in my memory?
The work is a change of personal behavior based on nihilism to conduct a self-analysis. What will be left behind? What will be remembered? What is meaningful? What is precious?
